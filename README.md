Real-Time Messaging Platform
A real-time messaging platform that allows users to send and receive messages, create chat rooms, and exchange messages with other users in real time. The backend services are hosted on Firebase, and users authenticate with their Google accounts.

Features
Google User Authentication: Users can log in and log out using their Google accounts via Firebase Authentication.

Chat Rooms: Users can create, join, and leave chat rooms.

Real-Time Messaging: Messages sent by users appear in the chat room in real time.

Message History: The chat application stores the history of messages for each chat room, which is visible to users when they join the room.

Private Messaging: Users can send private messages to other users.

Technologies Used
Firebase: Backend services, including Firebase Authentication and Firestore for data storage.
JavaScript: Programming language used for frontend and backend development.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling of the user interface.
Real-Time Communication: WebSocket or Firebase Realtime Database for real-time messaging.
